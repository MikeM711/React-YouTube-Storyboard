# React-YouTube-Storyboard

**Work in progress**

A React app that will take a YouTube video and create a storyboard out of it, using screenshots and captions

## What it solves
Instead of watching a whole entire YouTube video to get some information, we can quickly gather video information using screenshots and the transcripts provided by YouTube.

## What it does

The application does the following:
1. Downloads the YouTube video
2. Takes the downloaded YouTube video and splits it into images at each second
3. Gets the caption text and caption time from the YouTube video
4. Creates a storyboard using the caption info and the split images
